Accordingly, several categories of OSM contributors are characterized based on the quantity and quality of their shared data. As such "beginners", "regular mappers", "intermediate mappers", "experts", and "professional mappers" are identified. The categorization of contributors proves the 90-9-1 rule applies in this study as well. A small number of contributors are professional and share the most information accurately, conversely, a large number of contributors contribute to OSM with the least amount of contribution and the minimal quality.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The need for assessing the risk of extreme weather events is ever increasing. In addition to quantification of risk today, the role of aggravating factors such as high population growth and changing climate conditions matters, too. We present the open-source software CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation), which integrates hazard, exposure, and vulnerability to compute the necessary metrics to assess risk and to quantify socio-economic impact. The software design is modular and object oriented, offering a simple collaborative framework and a parallelization strategy which allows for scalable computations on clusters. CLIMADA supports multi-hazard calculations and provides an event-based probabilistic approach that is globally consistent for a wide range of resolutions, suitable for whole-country to detailed local studies. This paper uses the platform to estimate and contextualize the damage of hurricane Irma in the Caribbean in 2017. Most of the affected islands are non-sovereign countries and also rely on overseas support in case disaster strikes. The risk assessment performed for this region, based on remotely available data available shortly before or hours after landfall of Irma, proves to be close to reported damage and hence demonstrates a method to provide readily available impact estimates and associated uncertainties in real time.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are particularly vulnerable to TCs, as they generally have limited financial resources to overcome past impacts and mitigate future risk. However, risk assessments for SIDS are scarce due to limited meteorological, exposure, and vulnerability data. In this study, we combine recent research advances in these three disciplines to estimate TC wind risk under past (1980\textendash 2017) and near-future (2015\textendash 2050) climate conditions. Our results show that TC risk strongly differs per region, with 91\% of all risk constituted in the North Atlantic. The highest risk estimates are found for the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, with present-climate expected annual damages (EAD) of 1.51 billion and 1.25 billion USD, respectively. This study provides valuable insights in TC risk and its spatial distribution, and can serve as input for future studies on TC risk mitigation in the SIDS.},

  abstract = {Flood risk modelling aims to quantify the probability of flooding and the resulting consequences for exposed elements. The assessment of flood damage is a core task that requires the description of complex flood damage processes including the influences of flooding intensity and vulnerability characteristics. Multi-variable modelling approaches are better suited for this purpose than simple stage\textendash damage functions. However, multi-variable flood vulnerability models require detailed input data and often have problems in predicting damage for regions other than those for which they have been developed. A transfer of vulnerability models usually results in a drop of model predictive performance. Here we investigate the questions as to whether data from the open-data source OpenStreetMap is suitable to model flood vulnerability of residential buildings and whether the underlying standardized data model is helpful for transferring models across regions. We develop a new data set by calculating numerical spatial measures for residential-building footprints and combining these variables with an empirical data set of observed flood damage. From this data set random forest regression models are learned using regional subsets and are tested for predicting flood damage in other regions. This regional split-sample validation approach reveals that the predictive performance of models based on OpenStreetMap building geometry data is comparable to alternative multi-variable models, which use comprehensive and detailed information about preparedness, socio-economic status and other aspects of residential-building vulnerability. The transfer of these models for application in other regions should include a test of model performance using independent local flood data. Including numerical spatial measures based on OpenStreetMap building footprints reduces model prediction errors (MAE \textendash{} mean absolute error \textendash{} by 20 \% and MSE \textendash{} mean squared error \textendash{} by 25 \%) and increases the reliability of model predictions by a factor of 1.4 in terms of the hit rate when compared to a model that uses only water depth as a predictor. This applies also when the models are transferred to other regions which have not been used for model learning. Further, our results show that using numerical spatial measures derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints does not resolve all problems of model transfer. Still, we conclude that these variables are useful proxies for flood vulnerability modelling because these data are consistent (i.e. input variables and underlying data model have the same definition, format, units, etc.) and openly accessible and thus make it easier and more cost-effective to transfer vulnerability models to other regions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} One of the challenges in globally consistent assessments of physical climate risks is the fact that asset exposure data are either unavailable or restricted to single countries or regions. We introduce a global high-resolution asset exposure dataset responding to this challenge. The data are produced using ``lit population'' (LitPop), a globally consistent methodology to disaggregate asset value data proportional to a combination of nightlight intensity and geographical population data. By combining nightlight and population data, unwanted artefacts such as blooming, saturation, and lack of detail are mitigated. Thus, the combination of both data types improves the spatial distribution of macroeconomic indicators. Due to the lack of reported subnational asset data, the disaggregation methodology cannot be validated for asset values. Therefore, we compare disaggregated gross domestic product (GDP) per subnational administrative region to reported gross regional product (GRP) values for evaluation. The comparison for 14 industrialized and newly industrialized countries shows that the disaggregation skill for GDP using nightlights or population data alone is not as high as using a combination of both data types. The advantages of LitPop are global consistency, scalability, openness, replicability, and low entry threshold. The open-source LitPop methodology and the publicly available asset exposure data offer value for manifold use cases, including globally consistent economic disaster risk assessments and climate change adaptation studies, especially for larger regions, yet at considerably high resolution.

The SDG 1.5 explicitly aims to reduce the vulnerability and exposure to climate related hazards by 2030. The World Risk Index (WRI) is one well-respected approach in profiling countries risk to natural hazard. To effectively monitor development and detect decision points on the climate resilience pathway, data of high resolution in space and time about the world's countries is of urgent importance. The World Risk Index will guide the supervised learning part resulting in an indicator set derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM) tags, establishing on one hand an open risk index and adding deep explanatory power to its components by a qualitative discussion of the OSM themes. The second part explores with unsupervised algorithms the inherent characteristic of country groups classified by the open risk index and deduces common patterns of socio-economic vulnerability. Hence, the inherent challenge of this work is to substitute existing static indicators with new dynamic indicators, not only substituting them but also painting a more detailed picture. Moreover, new data sources still questioned often by their reliability compared to World Bank or census data, and therefore its opportunities are neglected instead of critically exploring the potential. This unique combination is not done yet and bares huge potential moreover united with the open source geo community to contribute a little piece of the puzzle for achieving the SDG 1.5.},

  abstract = {The IPCC states that climate change unequivocally impacts on various aspects of the natural and built environment, including our vital critical infrastructure systems (transport, energy, water/wastewater and communications). It is thus essential for countries to gain an understanding of critical infrastructure vulnerability to current and future climate-related threats, in order to develop effective climate adaptation strategies. The first requisite step towards implementing these strategies, before any detailed analysis can commence, is high-level vulnerability or risk assessments. The work in this paper is concerned with such high-level assessments, however the framework presented is GIS-based, facilitating modelling of geographical variability in both climate and asset vulnerability within a country. This permits the identification of potential climate change risk hotspots across a range of critical infrastructure sectors. The framework involves a number of distinct steps. Sectoral information matrices are developed to highlight the key relationships between the infrastructure and climate threats. This information is complemented with sectoral maps showing, on an asset-level, the potential geospatial impacts of climate change, facilitating initial quantification of the vulnerable portions of the infrastructure systems. Finally, the approach allows for development of multi-sectoral semi-quantitative risk ranking maps that account for the geographical proximities of various assets from different critical infrastructure sectors which are vulnerable to a specific climate threat. The framework is presented in the paper and applied as a case study in the context of Irish critical infrastructure. The case-study identified for instance, potentially substantial increases in fluvial flooding risk for Irish critical infrastructure, while the multi-sectoral risk ranking maps highlighted a number of Ireland's urban and rural areas as climate change risk hotspots. These high-level insights are likely to be useful in informing more detailed assessment, and initiating important conversations relating to a region's critical infrastructure cross-sectoral risk.},

This increases the usefulness of Volunteered Geographic Information  (VGI), in particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), as supplementary datasets or, in some cases, alternative sources of primary data. In contrast to the OSM street network, which has already been thoroughly investigated and found to be practically complete in many areas, the degree of completeness of OSM data on buildings is still unclear. In this paper we describe methods to analyze building completeness and apply these to various test areas in Germany. Official data from national mapping and cadastral agencies is used as a basis for comparison. The results show that unit-based completeness measurements (e.g., total number or area of buildings) are highly sensitive to disparities in modeling between official data and VGI. Therefore, we recommend object-based methods to study the completeness of OSM building footprint data. An analysis from November 2011 in Germany indicated a completeness of 25\% in the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and 15\% in Saxony. Although further analyses from 2012 confirm that data completeness in Saxony has risen to 23\%, the rate of new data input was slowing in the year 2012.},

Here, we present a new feature of the climate-risk modelling platform CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation), which allows us to carry out global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. CLIMADA underpins the Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) methodology which provides decision-makers with a fact base to understand the impact of weather and climate on their economies, communities, and ecosystems, including the appraisal of bespoke adaptation options today and in future. We apply the new feature to an ECA analysis of risk from tropical cyclone storm surge to people in Vietnam to showcase the comprehensive treatment of uncertainty and sensitivity of the model outputs, such as the spatial distribution of risk exceedance probabilities or the benefits of different adaptation options. We argue that broader application of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis will enhance transparency and intercomparison of studies among climate-risk modellers and help focus future research. For decision-makers and other users of climate-risk modelling, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis has the potential to lead to better-informed decisions on climate adaptation.

Since OSM data is created by volunteers and without strict mapping rules, the OSM tags used to mark geographic objects may vary across space. This is especially the case for urban green spaces which leads to different representations of them in OSM. A good understanding of these differences is necessary for the design of a universally applicable algorithm for urban vegetation mapping using OSM data. This study explores which OSM tags indicate urban green spaces, how strong this indication is and how much this varies across different regions. This is done using an exploratory data analysis based on statistical and graphical methods applied to four different cities. Results show that the representation of urban vegetation is influenced by socio-cultural context and the purpose of the map production. Furthermore, the inherent vagueness in the conceptualization of natural objects leads to different associations between OSM tags and vegetation presence across regions.},

Mapping fire ignition probabilities across countries can be a useful tool for fire risk mitigation. This study was conducted to: (i) evaluate the contribution of the variables obtained from open-source datasets (i.e., MODIS, OpenStreetMap, and WorldClim) for modeling fire ignition probability at the country level; and (ii) investigate how well the Random Forest (RF) method performs from one country to another. The importance of the predictors was evaluated using the Gini impurity method, and RF was evaluated using the ROC-AUC and confusion matrix. The most important variables were the topographic wetness index in the AT model and slope in the CZ model. The AUC values in the validation sets were 0.848 (AT model) and 0.717 (CZ model). When the respective models were applied to the entire dataset, they achieved 82.5\% (AT model) and 66.4\% (CZ model) accuracy. Cross-comparison revealed that the CZ model may be successfully applied to the AT dataset (AUC = 0.808, Acc = 82.5\%), while the AT model showed poor explanatory power when applied to the CZ dataset (AUC = 0.582, Acc = 13.6\%). Our study provides insights into the effect of the accuracy and completeness of open-source data on the reliability of national-level forest fire probability assessment.},

  abstract = {Critical infrastructures are more exposed than ever to natural hazards in a chaning climate. To understand and manage risk, failure cascades across large, real-world infrastructure networks, caused by real-world hazards, and their impact on people, must be captured. Bridging established methods in both infrastructure and risk modelling communities, we develop an open-source modelling framework which integrates a network-based interdependent infrastructure system model into the globally consistent and spatially explicit natural hazard risk assessment platform CLIMADA. The model captures infrastructure damages, triggers failure cascades and estimates resulting basic service disruptions for the dependent population. It flexibly operates on large areas with publicly available hazard, exposure and vulnerability information, for any infrastructure networks, hazards and geographies of interest. In a validated case study for 2018's Hurricane Michael across three US states, the model reproduced important failure dynamics among six infrastructure networks, and provided a novel spatial map of where people were likely to experience disruptions in access to healthcare, loss of power and other vital services. Our generalized approach allows for a view on infrastructure risks and their social impacts also in areas where detailed information and risk assessments are traditionally scarce, informing humanitarian activities through hotspot analyses and policy frameworks alike.},

We present a first-of-its-kind globally harmonized spatial dataset for the representation of CI. In this study, we: (1) collect and harmonize detailed geospatial data of the world's main CI systems into a single geospatial database; and (2) develop the Critical Infrastructure Spatial Index (CISI) to express the global spatial intensity of CI. The CISI aggregates high-resolution geospatial OpenStreetMap (OSM) data of 39 CI types that are categorized under seven overarching CI systems. The detailed geospatial data are rasterized into a harmonized and consistent dataset with a resolution of 0.10\,\texttimes\,0.10 and 0.25\,\texttimes\,0.25 degrees. The dataset can be applied to explore the current landscape of CI, identify CI hotspots, and as exposure input for large-scale risk assessments.},

Still larger completeness areas can be derived if not only metadata but also the actual content of the database is taken into account.

Yet societal decisions on preventive actions depend on the expected impacts of the weather event. In order to better inform such preventive actions, meteorological services are currently working towards including expected impacts into their warnings. We develop an open-source impact forecasting system for building damage due to winter windstorms in Switzerland. It combines a numerical ensemble weather prediction model with exposure and vulnerability data. This system forecasts expected building damage in Swiss Francs with a 2-day lead time on a 500-m grid or aggregated to administrative regions. We compare the forecasted building damage with insurance claims in the canton of Zurich. The uncertainty of the impact forecasts is large. For the majority of days with severe winter windstorm damage, the mean forecasted damage was in the right order of magnitude, with one missed event and one false alarm. For thunderstorms and foehn storms, the rate of missed events and false alarms is much higher, most likely related to the limited meteorological forecast skill. Such impact forecasts can inform decision makers on preventive actions, such as allocating emergency response and other assets. Additionally, impact forecasts could also help communicating the severity of the upcoming event to the general public as well as indirectly help meteorological forecasters with taking warning decisions.},

  abstract = {Responsiveness and resilience to coastal disasters is an increasingly critical need for governments, businesses, and communities as the intensity of hurricanes, coastal storms and sea level rise exacerbates flood and erosion damages. The number and severity of disasters have increased significantly over the past two decades while intense coastal development has steadily degraded the protective and other ecosystem benefits from natural habitats such as coral reefs, mangroves and seagrasses. Such ecosystems can provide cost-effective, long-term risk reduction and other benefits to coastal communities. Yet easy, low-cost methodologies for incorporating such natural capital values into metrics that can inform policy and investment decisions have been lacking until recently. Whereas new approaches and studies have developed ways to quantify and assess such risk reduction benefits, finding the data to assess such services in data poor environments, both for regional and local scales, remains challenging. This paper outlines how breakthroughs in data technologies can help with incorporating ecosystem benefits into real-world policy and investment applications. Specific new data and analytical technologies are increasingly being used to quantify coastal risk reduction and other ecosystem benefits. We review several case studies where ecosystem benefits were quantified based on new data technologies and used for policy and investment strategies to improve a broader suite of ecosystem benefits to coastal communities. Equipping public and private sector actors with cost-effective and accessible approaches and tools to incorporate nature-based solutions into disaster risk management and coastal zone management planning more generally can transform climate resilience strategies around the world.},

In this study, a climate index estimating rainfall patterns which trigger landslides in central Europe is analysed until the end of this century and compared to present-day conditions. The analysis of the potential future development of landslide risk is based on an ensemble of dynamically downscaled climate projections which are driven by the SRES A1B socio-economic scenario. Resulting regional-scale climate change projections across central Europe are concatenated with Europe's road and railway network. Results indicate overall increases of landslide occurrence. While flat terrain at low altitudes exhibits an increase of about 1 more potentially landslide-inducing rainfall period per year until the end of this century, higher elevated regions are more affected and show increases of up to 14 additional periods. This general spatial distribution emerges in the near future (2021\textendash 2050) but becomes more pronounced in the remote future (2071\textendash 2100). Since largest increases are to be found in Alsace, potential impacts of an increasing amount of landslides are discussed using the example of a case study covering the Black Forest mountain range in Baden-W\"urttemberg by further enriching the climate information with additional geodata. The findings derived are suitable to support political decision makers and European authorities in transport, freight and logistics by offering detailed information on which parts of Europe's ground transport network are at particularly high risk concerning landslide activity.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem service (ES) mapping has been developed with the aim of supporting ecosystem management, but ES maps often lack information about uncertainty and risk, which is essential for decision-making. In this paper, we use a risk-based approach to map ES in mountain forests, which are experiencing an increasing rate of natural disturbances, such as windthrow, bark beetle outbreaks, and forest fires. These disturbances affect the capacity of forests to provide essential ecosystem services, such as protection from natural hazards, wood production, and carbon sequestration, thus posing a challenge for forest management. At the same time, disturbances may also have a positive effect on certain services, e.g. by improving habitats for species that rely on dead wood. We integrate forests' susceptibility to natural disturbances into probabilistic Bayesian Network models of a set of ES (avalanche protection, carbon sequestration, recreation, habitats, and wood production), which combine information from remote sensing, social media and in-situ data, existing process-based models, and local expert knowledge. We use these models to map the level of the services and the associated uncertainties under scenarios with and without natural disturbances in two case study areas in the Swiss Alps. We use clustering to identify bundles of risk to ES, and compare the patterns of risk between the non-protected area of Davos and the strictly protected area of the Swiss National park with its surroundings. The spatially heterogeneous pattern of risk to ES reflects topographic variability and the forest characteristics that drive disturbance susceptibility, but also the demand for ecosystem services. In the landscape of Davos, the most relevant risks to ES are related to decreases in the protection against avalanches and carbon sequestration, as well as some risk to wood production and recreation. In the strictly protected Swiss National Park, the overall level of ES risk is lower, with an increase in habitat quality under the disturbance scenario. This risk-based approach can help identify stands with high levels of ES that are particularly susceptible to disturbances, as well as forests with a more stable ES provision, which can help define priorities in forest management planning.},

A new set of road-specific damage functions is developed. The expected annual direct damage from large river floods to road infrastructure in Europe is EUR 230 million per year. Compared to grid-based approaches, the object-based approach is more precise and provides more action perspective for road owners because it calculates damage directly for individual road segments while accounting for segment-specific attributes. This enables the identification of European hotspots, such as roads in the Alps and along the Sava River. A first comparison to a reference case shows that the new object-based method computes realistic damage estimates, paving the way for targeted risk reduction strategies.},

This work focuses on how to assess the quality of OSM via deep learning and high-resolution remote imagery. First, considering that high-resolution remote sensing imagery is clear enough for recognizing buildings, we proposed using multi-task deep-convolutional networks to extract buildings in pixel level. The extracted buildings were converted into polygons with geographical coordinates, which were treated as reference data. Then, OSM footprint data were matched with the reference data. Quality was assessed in terms of both positional accuracy and data completeness. Finally, the building footprint data of OSM for the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, were evaluated. The experiments show that the proposed method can assess OSM effectively and accurately. The results show that building extracted by the proposed method can be treated as a new data source for assessing OSM quality and can also be used for urban planning in regions where OSM lacks building data.},

  abstract = {Major airports are already at risk of coastal flooding. Sea level rise associated with a global mean temperature rise of 2~\textdegree C would place 100 airports below mean sea level, whilst 1238 airports are in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone. A global analysis has assessed the risk to airports in terms of expected annual disruption to routes. The method integrates globally available data of airport location, flight routes, extreme water levels, standards of flood protection and scenarios of sea level rise. Globally, the risk of disruption could increase by a factor of 17\textendash 69 by 2100, depending on the rate of sea level rise. A large number of airports are at risk in Europe, Norther American and Oceania, but risks are highest in Southeast and East Asia. These coastal airports are disproportionately important to the global airline network, by 2100 between 10 and 20\% of all routes are at risk of disruption. Sea level rise therefore poses a systemic risk to global passenger and freight movements. Airports already benefit from substantial flood protection that reduces present risk by a factor of 23. To maintain risk in 2100 at current levels could cost up to \$57BN. Although the cost of protecting larger airports is higher, busier airports are typically well protected and more likely to have better access to adaptation finance. However, 995 coastal airports operate 5 commercial routes or fewer. More detailed consideration of these airports shows that regions, especially low lying islands, will experience disproportionate impacts because airports can provide important economic, social, and medical lifelines. Route disruption was used as the risk metric due to its global coverage and relationship with direct economic impacts. Further work should collate a wider range of impact metrics that reflect the criticality of an airport in terms of the isolation and socio-economic context of the location it serves.},

  abstract = {OpenStreetMap (OSM) is currently an important source for building data, despite the existence of potential quality issues. Previous studies have assessed OSM data quality by comparing it with reference building data, which may not otherwise be readily available. This study assessed OSM building completeness using population data, and investigated the effectiveness of using population data for building reference data. We proposed various approaches, including type-based and regression-based approaches and their subtypes, and designed measures and methods to evaluate these approaches. Our evaluation examined four study areas in two countries, using global population data sets at three spatial resolutions (1-km, 100-m, and 30-m). Results showed that the type-based approach correctly classified approximately 80\textendash 99\% of the assessed grid cells. The regression-based approach resulted in a high linear correlation (0.7 or greater) between the population counts and the referenced building count/building area size, with the strongest correlation present for the 1-km population dataset. We conclude that the use of population data as referenced building data is an effective method for the assessment of OSM building completeness. The paper concludes with the advantages and limitations of using both the type-based and the regression-based approaches.},

  abstract = {Warming on Earth's Third Pole is leading to rapid loss of ice and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes, posing a severe threat to downstream communities. Here we provide a holistic assessment of past evolution, present state and modelled future change of glacial lakes and related glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) risk across the Third Pole. We show that the highest GLOF risk is at present centred in the eastern Himalaya, where the current risk level is at least twice that in adjacent regions. In the future, GLOF risk will potentially almost triple as a consequence of further lake development, and additional hotspots will emerge to the west, including within transboundary regions. With apparent increases in GLOF risk already anticipated by the mid-twenty-first century in some regions, the results highlight the urgent need for forward-looking, collaborative, long-term approaches to mitigate future impacts and enhance sustainable development across the Third Pole.},

  abstract = {OpenStreetMap (OSM) can supply useful information to improve land-cover/land-use (LCLU) mapping. However, many concerns have been paid attention to OSM data quality, because the data were edited by global volunteers and they have only been assessed at a city/regional scale rather than at a global scale. This study assesses the quality of OSM-LCLU data for 168 countries worldwide. OSM-based LC datasets are firstly produced for different countries by referring to global open LC data, and these dataset are then compared in terms of accuracy and completeness. Moreover, a number of variables and three regression models (OLS, SLM and SEM) are used to understand the accuracy and completeness patterns at a global scale. We found that: 1) although most countries are characterized by a low completeness, they have a relatively high accuracy. 2) Both socio-economic variables and the area percentages of various OSM-LCLU types have been found to be significantly correlated with these patterns. 3) The SLM and SEM models are preferred, and most of countries with a relatively high completeness are spatially aggregated in Europe. Not only the global pattern of the OSM-LCLU data quality have been recovered, but also the analytical method can be applied to different countries and regions.},
